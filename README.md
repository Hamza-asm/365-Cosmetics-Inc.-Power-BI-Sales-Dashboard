# 365 Cosmetics Inc. – Power BI Sales & Profitability Dashboard

## Business Problem
365 Cosmetics Inc. has achieved strong top-line growth with a **23.82% year-over-year increase in sales**, yet the business is facing a critical **profitability crisis**. Management identified three structural challenges threatening long-term sustainability:

- **Profitless Growth:**  
  While total orders and quantity surged by over **24%**, total profit declined by **12.16%**, indicating that acquisition and operational costs are outpacing revenue generation.

- **Ineffective Pricing Strategy:**  
  Aggressive discounting eroded margins. Lack of visibility into discount thresholds resulted in a **5.23% decline in profit margin**.

- **Regional & Segment Opacity:**  
  Revenue concentration in mature markets (e.g., the US) masked significantly higher profitability in emerging markets such as **China and India**.

### Key Findings
- **Divergent Trends:** Sales and order growth remain strong, while profit declines—signaling a structurally broken pricing model.
- **Margin Compression:** Revenue growth is being driven by **unsustainable discounting**, not margin expansion.
- **Volume Drivers:** Strong demand (25,728 orders; 277,778 units) confirms the issue is **strategic**, not product-market fit.

### Key Findings
- **The US Paradox:** ~36% of total revenue but materially lower margins.
- **Emerging Efficiency:** China and India deliver the **highest profit margins (~30%)**, reflecting stronger pricing power.
- **Growth Potential:** African markets show consistent growth despite low current revenue contribution.

### Key Findings
- **Volume vs. Value:** Consumer segment dominates customer count (51.6%) but dilutes profitability.
- **High-Value Segment:** Self-Employed customers generate the **highest margins** despite the lowest volume.
- **Corporate Inefficiency:** High sales volumes offset by margin erosion from negotiated bulk discounts.

### Key Findings
- **31% Discount Threshold:** Products discounted above **31% consistently generate losses**.
- **Category Drag:** Home & Accessories operates at a net loss despite revenue contribution.
- **Pareto Effect:** A small subset of products and segments contributes disproportionately to total profit.

---

## Strategic Verdict & Summary
365 Cosmetics Inc. is successfully acquiring customers but failing to monetize them efficiently. Sustained growth requires an immediate shift from a **volume-first** to a **margin-first** strategy, supported by tighter discount controls and a reallocation of investment toward high-margin markets and customer segments.
